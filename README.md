# 42_CPP03
This project involves creating a robot hierarchy in C++ starting with the ClapTrap class, with basic attributes (name, hit points, energy, damage) and methods for attacking, repairing, and taking damage. The derived classes ScavTrap, FragTrap, and DiamondTrap add unique abilities, showcasing inheritance and composition in C++.
